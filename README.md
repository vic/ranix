# ranix

A Nix language parser implemented in C. Uses Ragel GOTO-driven FSM for C. This project is being used as a library for an in-progress Nix compiler implemented in a secret higher-level language.

(ragel and bison code originally based on https://github.com/orivej/go-nix and updated with fixes for parsing most of nixpkgs as of 16-08-2025 only one file fails)
